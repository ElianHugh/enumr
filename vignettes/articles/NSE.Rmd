You can use `.` to refer to the current enum<sup>1</sup>. Specifically, when defining variables, you can use `.$` to refer to other elements in the enum. E.g.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Numeric enum
enum(
    a,
    b,
    c = .$a + 10,
    d = .$c * .$b
)

enum(
    a = "Hello",
    b = c(.$a, "world")
)

```

It should be noted, however, there are limitations to defining members with `.$`. Firstly, enum member validation is performed *sequentially*. That is, each non-explicit member is initialised in order of their definition. As a result, computed members cannot refer to later *non-explicit* members. For instance:

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Invalid definition!
enum(
    a,
    b = .$c + 1,
    c
)

# Valid due to explicit initialisation
enum(
    a,
    b = .$c + 1,
    c = 50
)

enum(
    a = .$c + 1,
    b = .$a + 1,
    c = 5
)
```

Moreover, due to sequential initialisation, enum members do not support cyclical evaluation.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Invalid
enum(
    a = .$b + 1,
    b = .$c + 1,
    c = .$a + 1
)
```

<sup>1</sup> Technically, `.` (dot) refers to the arguments supplied in the enum constructor. The arguments are converted to a list, and the dot operator acts as a reference to said list.
