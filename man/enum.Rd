enum(...)
}

\item{...}{list of enumerator arguments}
}
\value{
enum
}
\description{
Define an enumerator to access values from. Values cannot be reassigned.
Values can be anything (within reason).
}
\details{
Enums defined without initialisers are considered numeric enums, and have
their values set to incrementing numbers. Numeric enums can also be a mix of
defined numeric values and undefined members.

Under the surface, enums are actually lists contained within locked environments.
This is so that the enum bindings cannot be modified, and the enum order is maintained.
S3 methods are defined for \code{$}, \code{[}, and \code{[[}, which access the enum list directly.

\examples{
fruits <- enum(apple = "apple", pear = "pear")
errors <- enum(style, warning, error)
data <- enum(dat1 = mtcars, dat2 = iris, dat3 = PlantGrowth)
mixed_enum <- enum(a = 5, b = mtcars, c = 50, d = "elephant")
computed_enum <- enum(a = 50, b = .$a * 2)
